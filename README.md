# Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates object detection, a computer vision technique to identify and locate objects in images or videos by labeling and highlighting them with bounding boxes.

## Features
- Detects multiple objects in images or videos.
- Labels objects and draws bounding boxes.
- Uses pre-trained models like YOLO, Faster R-CNN, or SSD for accuracy and speed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/object-detection.git
